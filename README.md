# Cars-or-Humans-Classifier

### Classification model that uses a simple convolutional neural network to distinguish humans from vehicles. Made using Tensorflow and Keras. The model is trained with (number) of images containing humans and (number) of images containing cars.

##### Human dataset: (link)
##### Cars dataset: (link)

## Model architecture

```

```



## Demonstration with random images from Google

#### Image of a car

![image of a car]()

#### Output:

```

```

#### Image of a human

![Image of a human]()

#### Output:

```

```


#### Let's see if a picture of a person whose legs are concealed will generate the correct output;

![Image of a woman wearing a dress]()

#### Output:

```

```

#### What if there are both cars and humans in a picture?

![image of a human and a car]()

#### Output:

```

```

#### Since this is not a multi label classifier the most prominent object in this picture is recognized which in this case is the human
